# KNN Demo

This KNN demo implements a knn algorithm to predict classes on the iris dataset.

How to run:
1. Download the entire `LoeberML` repository
2. Navigate into the `knn` directory and open the terminal
3. Check that you are in the right directory by running
```bash
pwd
```
4. Confirm that the command above outputs
```bash
/path/to/LoeberML/knn
```
5. Execute the program by running
```bash
bash knn_execute.sh
```
*Note that this may take up to two minutes, since libraries need to be installed.*
